## How to navigate

- Some maps will not load location currently (because of incorrect texture), so see it in the initial map itself. That is correct
- - The time feature is still in works because of lack of future maps
- Click Header (-ClimaVisor-) for going to Dashboard page
- There is an Impact calculator at the bottom to calculate CO2 savings
- In the reports page, there is a sidebar open it to select countries so see their weekly data and climate predictions
